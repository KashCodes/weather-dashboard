# Weather Dashboard

### Instructions:

Search for a city and you will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.  Each search will include the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. Additionally, the UV index will display a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Below that you will see a 5-Day forecast that will show the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. If you click on a city from the search history it will display the same updated information.
